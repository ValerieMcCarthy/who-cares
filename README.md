# README

WhoCares is the best place we can find out what we care about. LinkedIn tells your professional story. WhoCares tells your personal story: what you care about and what you choose to support. LinkedIn reveals your skills. WhoCares uncovers your values. Let others know who you are and connect with like minded people. 

## Install
To launch the app:

```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rails s
```
The PostGres database needs to be running in your local environment for this app to function. Soon we will move to a 3rd party hosting site (Heroku). 

If you would like to see sample data, seed the data base with:
```
rake db:seed
```
